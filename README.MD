# :postbox: Faq

**Question:** What are the tecnologies used in this project?

##
**Question:** How the multi language support is handled by the server?

**Answer:** This application handle multi language support with the help of a library called [i18n-node](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node). It has a middleware that gather language settings of visitors and then persist translations from [JSON files](https://github.com/Andrevft/pokedex/tree/master/src/locales) related with a specific locale.

The locale is storaged as a cookie named ```pokedex:locale``` and that can be changed by passing a query string with the value ```?lang=pt```
